Welcome to my personal portfolio! I am a passionate software engineer focused on backend development, specializing in building modern, high performance, and scalable web applications. This site highlights my projects, skills, and experience in a unique terminal-inspired interface.

## About Me
I am a software engineer with a strong focus on backend development and a passion for creating efficient, scalable web solutions. With expertise in modern technologies and best practices, I enjoy tackling complex problems and delivering high-quality applications.

My technical toolkit includes JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, Golang, Laravel, and various cloud platforms. I'm committed to writing clean, maintainable code and continuously expanding my knowledge in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
* [Winbox.js](https://github.com/nextapps-de/winbox)
* [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
* [AWS API Gateway / Lambda Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
This repo was created and designed to serve as my personal portfolio. Hovewer you can clone and use it as you see fit. 
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

* npm

  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  npm install --global yarn
  ```

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Kielx/terminal-portfolio.git
   ```

2. Install NPM packages

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Now that the portfolio is installed you can run it locally and make it your own. Where do you start?

### Projects

The list of projects and mini-projects are generated automatically by Gatsby from markdown files in this folder. Set up the list of your projects by opening ```/src/markdown-pages/``` projects folder. Next, you should delete all of my projects while leaving one .md file as a template. Then update it accordingly:

```markdown
/* src/markdown-pages/projects/your-project-name.md */
---
slug: "projects/country-quiz"
nameOfClass: "projects-items"
title: "Country Quiz"
listName: "ðŸŒŽ /Country Quiz"
popupImageSrc: "country-quiz.webp"
popupImageAlt: "Country Quiz screenshot"
popupLiveLink: "https://country-quiz.pantak.net/"
popupGithubLink: "https://github.com/Kielx/country-quiz"
techIcons: [
        "react",
        "html5",
        "css3",
        "tailwindcss",
      ]
---

The project description goes here.
```

This is the frontmatter of the .md file. The rendered project will display information based on the contents of this part of .md file.

* Slug is the link that Gatsby will generate for the page.
* nameOfClass is the class name of the item in the project's lits. I've split projects into two lists - projects-items and mini-projects. If you would like to add a new project you can stick with projects-items if you want it to be a mini-project just add mini-project to the class name like this `nameOfClass: "projects-items miniProjects"`.
* title - The title of the project that will be displayed inside Window
* List name - the name that will be displayed in the main terminal window
* popupImageSrc - the image that will be displayed in the popup window. It should be an image that is inside the `/static` folder.
* techIcons - an array of tech icons that will be displayed in popup window. Just add slugs of technologies that you want from [Simple Icons Slugs](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/blob/develop/slugs.md)

The second part of .md file contains a description that you can provide for your project as you see fit.

### About

The same rules as for projects apply to the about page.

### Colors and styling

Changing colors couldn't be easier. Just adjust colors in `/src/styles/styles.scss` file.
The default theme is black so update the colors as you see fit.

```scss
/* src/styles/styles.scss */
:root {
  --primaryText: #ffc600;
  --secondaryText: #ccc;
  --linkText: #047be3;
  --bg: #1b2d3a;
  --windowBg: #193549;
  --focusBg: hsl(205, 51%, 16%);
  --borderColor: black;
}
```

All colors should be self-explanatory except for:

* bg - this is the color of the outer background
* windowBg - this is the color of displayed windows
* focusBg - the color of focused window title bars

### Gatsby config

You should update file `/gatsby-config.js` to match your project. You should change `siteMetada` and `gatsby-plugin-manifest` where you should provide an icon for PWA that should be included in `src/images/your-image.jpg`. Finally be sure to change your GTAG in gatsby config - if you plan to use google analytics. Otherwise you are free to remove the plugin entireley by removing entry for `gatsby-plugin-google-gtag`

### Contact Form
There are many services that you can use to run your contact form.
In my example, I used AWS API Gateway + AWS Lambda Function + AWS SES because it's the cheapest of all the options and scales well. It isn't the easiest option to set up however. 
For a detailed guide on how to set up and use the contact form you can use the following [link](
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/create-dynamic-contact-forms-for-s3-static-websites-using-aws-lambda-amazon-api-gateway-and-amazon-ses/)

Alternatively, you can use Twilio Sendgrid or capture the form directly from Netlify forms if you host your version there.

### ENV Variables

You can set environment variables in `.env.development` file for local development, and `.env.production` for production.
Also you will need to set them up in netlify if you plan to deploy to their hosting. 

```sh
GATSBY_AWS_CONTACT_FORM_API_URL = 'Your AWS API form url' - this is the url of the form that will be used to send emails from the contact form.
GATSBY_AWS_CONTACT_FORM_X_API_KEY = 'Your AWS API form key' - this is the key of the form that will be used to send emails from the contact form.
GATSBY_GOOGLE_GTAG = 'Your Google GTAG' - this is the GTAG that will be used to track your site if you decide to use google analytics.
NODE_VERSION = '14' - this is the node version that will be used to build your project. This variable is only needed when you are using netlify.
```

### Additional changes

Next you should update following components:
`/src/components/layout` - Insert your name. <br>
`/src/components/header` - Change h1 with your own name. <br>

Change typewriter `typeString` to your needs.
```javaScript
// src/components/header.js
 <Typewriter
              style={{ marginTop: 0, paddingTop: 0 }}
              options={{
                deleteSpeed: "natural",
              }}
              onInit={typewriter => {
                typewriter
                  .typeString("Software Developer")
                  .pauseFor(2500)
                  .deleteAll()
                  .typeString("Problem solver")
                  .pauseFor(2500)
                  .deleteAll()
                  .typeString("Krzysztof Pantak")
                  .callFunction(() => {
                    setIsLoaded(true)
                  })
                  .start()
              }}
```
